#### This repository contains the files for the interactive D3 chart made to track the top 11 career(as of the end of the 2015-16 Season) three-point shooters, plus Stephen Curry, over time.

#### The vizualization can be seen here: https://rawgit.com/j-v-k/TopNBA3P/master/Build/index.html
 
####  The chart is a modifed version of Lutz Roeder's Grapher.Motion chart which can be found here: http://www.lutzroeder.com/html5/

#### I also added the Python code which I created and to convert the .csv files into the particular form of .json recognized by the Grapher.Motion chart. 

#### All data is scraped from basketball-reference.com
