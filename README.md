This repository contains the files for the interactive D3 chart made to track the Top 11 career(as of the end of the 2015-16 Season) three-point shooters, plus Stephen Curry, over time.

The vizualization can be seen here:

The chart is a modifed version of Lutz Roeder's Grapher.Motion chart which can be found here: http://www.lutzroeder.com/html5/

I also added the Python code which I created and used to convert .csv files into the particular form of .json which is recognized by the Grapher.Motion chart.
