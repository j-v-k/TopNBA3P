This repository contains the files for the interactive chart made to track the Top 11 current(as of the end of the 2015-16 Season) Three-Point Shooters, plus Stephen Curry, over time

The vizualization can be seen here: http://bl.ocks.org/j-v-k/raw/dbef2619e93cfc0f6b98a3a82a676296/

The chart is a modifed version of Lutz Roeder's Grapher.Motion chart which can be found here: http://www.lutzroeder.com/html5/

I also added the Python code which I created and used to convert .csv files into the particular form of .json file which is recognized by Grapher.Motion chart's .js code.
